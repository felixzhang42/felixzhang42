- 👋 Hi, I’m @felixzhang42
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, data analytics, app development, music, and of course, video games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, machine learning, flask, vue, docker...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on app development, both desktop and mobile.
- 📫 How to reach me: I prefer using traditional email yet felixzhang42@qq.com, probably will update my social account later on!
